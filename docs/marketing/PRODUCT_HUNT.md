## 3. First comment
Hello people üëã!

Curated directory are very popular on Product Hunt, it started with the lengendary Startup Stash, followed by Marketing Stack and hundred of others. 

I myself built 3 curated directory of resources, and my last one <a href="https://undesign.learn.uno">Undesign</a> is very useful (I use it almost everyday) and got pretty popular. Many people contact me every week to add new resources or just to talk and a few people asked me how to build a clone of it, some of them without coding knowledge. Therefore I decided to turn it to a <strong>easy to use template for coders</strong>, and go further by making <strong>it usable without a single line of code using Netlify CMS that provides an admin panel to add / edit the content of the website</strong>. Because this templates generates static page it can be hosted for free!

<strong>Why would I need to build a curated directory?</strong>
- To build the next best Product Hunt project
- To gather all your favorites websites in one place and be able to share them with your friends
- To gather all the tools that your company uses for your new employees so they don't get lost
- To showcase your products in one place
- To make the world a better place

<strong>Last but not least this templates comes with some out of the box features:</strong>
- No-code friendly using Netlify CMS
- Admin panel with Netlify CMS
- Search bar
- Automatic dark theme
- Floating Prompt (for Product Hunt or anything else)
- Google Analytics
- Script to analyze your links & categories
- Script to download websites logos automatically
